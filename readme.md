# Tic-Tac-Toe AI

## Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The AI works using the minimax algorithm which is a recursive,
brute force method of playing every possible move on the board
before picking the best possible one by weighing all the outcomes. To make the process more efficient, a technique called "Pruning" is used in which once a certain move has been calculated to win the game eventually, the calculation stops and the algorithm plays the calculated move instead of calculating however more moves it can calculate.

This is my first project using JavaScript.
Hope you enjoy :D
